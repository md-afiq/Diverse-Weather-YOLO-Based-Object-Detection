# Diverse-Weather-YOLO-Based-Object-Detection

This project implements a **YOLO-based object detection system** designed to operate in **diverse weather conditions** for autonomous vehicle applications.  
It can detect multiple object classes, including:

- **Vehicle**
- **Car**
- **Truck**
- **Person**
- **Motorcycle**
- **Traffic Light**

The system is trained and evaluated to ensure robust performance in challenging scenarios such as foggy, rainy, and clear weather conditions.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Features
- **YOLO Model**: Fast and accurate object detection.
- **Multi-Weather Robustness**: Handles fog, rain, and normal conditions.
- **Multi-Class Detection**: Identifies vehicles, people, motorcycles, trucks, and traffic lights.
- **Real-World Autonomous Driving Relevance**: Ideal for traffic monitoring, smart transport, and safety applications.
